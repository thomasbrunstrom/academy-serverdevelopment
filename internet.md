# Internet

## Task 1, find your local IP-address

### Method a

Start a command prompt or the terminal in visual studio code.

Type: `ipconfig` (windows), `ifconfig` (mac/linux)

### Method b

(Windows)

Click on the network icon in the taskbar and choose properties.

This is the local ip-address you have and computers on the same network can reach you on that one. It is not public and someone else outside your network can't reach your computer with that address.

## Task 2, find your public IP-address

Open a web browser and type in https://whatismyipaddress.com/

Your address should be in the blue box. (With some additional information, like your ISP, City and so on.)

## Task 3, Ping

Ping is a good way to see if you're able to reach a different machine. You'll also get information about how long it took for the computers to connect.

Try:

`ping google.com` and write down the ip-address you get back.

`ping www.google.com` and write down the ip-address. Are they the same? If not, why do you think that is?

Make a not over the times, do they differ?

Try this:

`ping www.canberra100.com.au` does it take longer then google?
